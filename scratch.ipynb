    "## 1. File Deleted but Not Staged/Committed (Still in Working Directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deleted the file (rm file.txt or via GUI) but haven't run git add or git commit yet, simply restore it from Git's index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git restore file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or (older Git versions):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -- file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. File Staged for Deletion (but Not Committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran git add (staged the deletion) but haven’t committed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git restore --staged file.txt  # Unstage deletion\n",
    "git restore file.txt           # Restore file\n",

    "## 3. File Deleted and Committed\n",
    "If the deletion was already committed, you need to recover it from Git history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: Find and Checkout the Last Commit That Had the File\n",
    "1. Find the commit where the file existed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log --diff-filter=D -- file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Look for the last commit before deletion.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Restore the file from that commit (<commit-hash>):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout <commit-hash>^ -- file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "(The ^ means \"the commit before deletion.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: Use git revert (If Deletion Was Recent)\n",
    "If you want to undo the entire commit that deleted the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git revert <commit-that-deleted-file> --no-edit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: Use git reflog (If You Lost the Commit)\n",
    "If you can’t find the commit, check reflog for recent actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reflog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then restore from a pre-deletion state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout HEAD@{n} -- file.txt  # Replace `n` with the reflog entry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. File Deleted in Multiple Commits (Deep Recovery)\n",
    "If the file was deleted long ago, search all Git history:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- file.txt  # Find last commit where file existed\n",
    "git checkout <commit-hash> -- file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Notes:\n",
    "- Git doesn’t truly \"delete\" files immediately—they linger in history until garbage collection (git gc).\n",
    "- If you pushed the deletion, you’ll need to git push again after restoring the file.\n",
    "- For permanently deleted files (after git gc), use file-recovery tools like photorec (but this is rare)."
